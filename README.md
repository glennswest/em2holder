# Emblazer 2 Magnetic Wood Holders
Where your laser cutting it's important to have a level piece so
the laser focus is well defined for the cut. My initial test plywood
tends to be warped, which makes results a bit unpredictable.

I like the emblasers cutting matts, but how to hold down the wood?

I've tried various weights, but wanted something consistant.
This occured to me, that a simple L bracket would would well, held down by
magnets.

This part is designed for the 10mm Emblaser mats, and 3mm plywood. The source is provided.
My plan is when cutting different thickness just print another set in a different color with
different material height.

## Parts List:
  em2holder.stl (print it in PLA is fine, no support needed)
  2 Recessed Round Magnets - 1.5 mm radius (3mm round) 5mm height with optional hole
  2 m3 round head screws (Optional)

Sourcing: 
  The magnets can be sourced from aliexpress. 

## Tools:
  I found vice grips allow you to press fit the magnets in very nicely. The screw is optional.
